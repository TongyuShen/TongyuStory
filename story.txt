	Hello, my name is Tongyu Shen. When I was 15 I wne to the US as an exchange student. I had a happy time there. That experience make up my mind to study abroad.
	Hi, Tongyu! I'm Aidan. Welcome to the United States. I hope you like it here. My favorite thing about the University of Wisconsin is all of the vibrant life, it is never dull here. My only problem here is that it is so cold
	Ni hao TongYu! Welcome to the US. I hope you are having a great time here. I am from California so I also had rough time adjusting to the cold weather. Right now, I am studying Chinese, so maybe you can help me practice speaking sometime.
	Good to see you Tongyu. I am a big fan of chinese food. we could have great chinese food together.
	It is a pleasure to meet you guys.I hope we can have fun when we work together.We can learn and have fun together as a group.
